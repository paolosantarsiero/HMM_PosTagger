# HMM_PosTagger

The project consists of developing a statistical morphological analyzer for ancient Greek and Latin, called POS Tagger, based on the Hidden Markov Model statistical technique, using two Treebanks from the UD project.
The development involves the implementation of four fundamental tasks:
* Learning and Decoding function
* Train the model
* Apply different smoothing strategies
* Evaluate the model
